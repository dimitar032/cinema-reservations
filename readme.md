# 🎬 Cinema Reservations – Thesis Project (2017)

Welcome to the Cinema Reservations project!  
This is a web application I started back in 2017 as part of my university thesis. It was an ambitious attempt to build a full cinema reservation system from scratch – with features like movie listings, seating maps, user authentication, ACL and more.

## 🚧 Status: Work in Progress

This project is **not completed**. At the time, it turned out to be a bit too complex for the scope of my thesis, so I had to wrap it up before reaching full functionality.

That said — I’m planning to **revive, expand, and modernize** this project. I’ve grown a lot as a developer since then, and I’m excited to bring this idea to life with fresh code, improved architecture, and a clean new UI.

If you’re here exploring this repo, please know that:
- It's a **work-in-progress**, and more like a prototype than a production app.
- The code might look a bit old-school – because it is! 
- I’m keeping this public as a way to show growth, and to track the evolution of the project over time.
